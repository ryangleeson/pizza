# pizza

I make pizza as a hobby. when filmmaking business is slow, I run an underground business of selling pizza.
sometimes frozen, sometimes i take my pizza oven places, sometimes we have a "restaurant" in our house.

here's a link to my instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pizza.ryan
i usually use the instagram stories to advertise when I am selling, as I have to 
avoid the Chicago Health Department!

this is an article written two years ago: https://fooditor.com/the-diy-indiana-pizza-utopia-of-east-garfield-park/

at home i use a pizza oven that cooks the pizza at 900* fahrenheit, and use a sourdough starter instead of yeast, so i use a different dough recipe, but this is one that i occasionally use on my kitchen oven when i don't feel like messing with the pizza oven.

link to a dough making video i made a couple weeks ago for a client: https://youtu.be/DQsm2DVNEEA
note that I use a scale to measure for better accuracy.

DOUGH

·  1 Cup + 2 Tbsp bread flour (156g)
·  1 Cup + 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (156g)
·  1 tsp fine sea salt (8g)
·  1 tsp active dry yeast (2g)
·  1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil (4g)
·  additional all-purpose flour for dusting the surface

watch the video for technique!

SAUCE

·  Can of whole plum tomatoes (I like expensive San Marzano tomatoes)
·  a couple fresh basil leaves
·  a bit of dried oregano
·  a clove of garlic
·  salt to taste

put all this stuff in a bowl and just crush it with your hands! this will leave some chunks of tomato and basil leaves that are nice for texture. also you do not cook this before, it goes on the pizza fresh and will cook in the oven!

TOPPINGS

whatever you want! but mozzarella cheese is important!

hopefully your dough is now a big fluffy ball. if you want to use a rolling pin to stretch it out, thats okay, just know that it will lose a lot of air that is trapped in the dough and the crust will not be as puffy. its kind of hard to explain but i like to sort of flatten the ball out with my fingers, and then hold it up and let gravity stretch it out. this video might be helpful for another way to do it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f9-xTcKzZo&t=72s

once stretched out, add some sauce and cheese!

bake in your oven as hot as it can go! a lot of factors will change the overall time, so just check on it! i know you have eaten pizza so you will know when it is done! i bake mine on a very hot sheet of steel in my oven but a baking sheet will work just fine!


i'll try to make a video about stretching out the dough this weekend!
